<h2>To determine the Impact toughness (strain energy) through Izod test and Charpy test</h2>
<h4>THEORY</h4>
<p>In a impact test a specially prepared notched specimen is fractured by a
single blow from a heavy hammer and energy required being a measure of resistance to
impact. Impact load is produced by a swinging of an impact weight W (hammer)
from
a height h. Release of the weight from the height h swings the weight through the arc of
a circle, which strikes the specimen to fracture at the notch (fig..
Kinetic energy of the hammer at the time of impact is mv2/2, which is equal to the relative potential energy of the hammer before its release. (mgh),where m is the mass of
the hammer and v 2gh is its tangential velocity at impact, g
is gravitational acceleration (9.806 m/s2) and h is the height
through which hammer falls. Impact velocity will be 5.126 m/s or slightly less.
Here it is interesting to note that height
through which hammer drops determines the velocity and height and mass of a hammer
combined determine the energy. Energy used can be measured from the scale
given. The difference between potential energies is the fracture energy. In
test machine this value indicated by the pointer on the scale. If the scale is
calibrated in energy units, marks on
the scale should be drawn keeping in view angle of fall () and angle of rise (. Height h1
and h2 equals,
(1 cos ) and (1 cos ) 1 2 h R h
With the increase or decrease in values, gap between marks on scale
showing energy also increase or decrease. This can be seen from
the attached scale with any impact machine.
Energy used in fracturing the specimen can be obtained approximately as Wh1Â­Wh2
This energy value called impact toughness or impact value, which will
be measured, per unit area at the notch.</p>
<h4>Izod test</h4>
<p>
Specimen and equipment
1. Impact testing machine
2.
Specimen and v notch is shown in the fig.4. Size of the specimen is 10mm X 10mm X 7
5mm
Mounting of the specimen:
Specimen is clamped to act as vertical cantilever with the notch on
tension side. Direction of blow of hammer is shown in fig. (). Direction of blow
</p>
<h4>PROCEDURE</h4>
<p>PROCEDURE:
1. Measure the dimensions of a specimen. Also, measure the dimensions of the notch.
2.
Raise the hammer and note down initial reading from the dial, which will be energy to be
used to fracture the specimen.
3.
Place the specimen for test and see that it is placed center with respect to hammer. Che
ck the position of notch.
4.
Release the hammer and note the final reading. Difference between the initial and final r
eading will give the actual energy required to fracture the Specimen.
5. Repeat the test for specimens of other materials.
6. Compute the energy of rupture of each specimen.
<h4>OBSERVATION</h4>
